These only worked with jupyter notebook, not lab.

A lot of the customization is not necessary anymore.

For JuliaMono font, I couldn't get an extension to work.
But Stylus browser extension works great 

With definitions like here https://juliamono.netlify.app/faq/#can_i_use_this_font_in_a_jupyter_notebook_and_how_do_i_do_it

but replace `div.output_area` w/ `div.jp-OutputArea-output`
Also I chose 14px instead of 16.

Stylus synched now via OneDrive.
